## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oroyinloye/socket-io-chat-app.git
cd your-repo-name

## Install Dependencies
npm install
cd client
npm install

## Environment Variables
cp .env.example .env
cp client/.env.example client/.env

## Update with your credentials:
# .env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=http://10.62.37.55:3000/

## Deployment Guide
## Backend (Render)
Push your code to GitHub
Create a new Web Service on Render
Set:
Build Command: npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run build
Start Command: node server.js
Environment Variables: Add PORT, MONGO_URI

## Frontend (Vercel)
Go to Vercel
Import your GitHub repo
Set client/ as the root directory
Add environment variables if needed

CI/CD Pipeline
âœ… GitHub Actions
CI/CD is configured using .github/workflows/deploy.yml. On every push to main, the pipeline:

Installs dependencies

Runs tests

Deploys to Vercel and Render
